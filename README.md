## Description
For the LGBTQ community, safety is of utmost importance. The ability to experience the world safely is not a luxury afforded to everyone and most often, members of the LGBTQ community rely on word-of-mouth to find businesses and resources that will provide safe havens and community. One of the most frequent roadblocks is the decentralization of such information.

**Safe Space offers a unique platform that helps the LGBTQ community safely expand their orbit by connecting members with resources, businesses and community.** With Safe Space, members are able to securely and swiftly login with a social media account or email and password to access a database of trusted businesses and community organizations.

Once in the app, users can:
- Review or update their profiles.
- Access a sortable listing of LGBTQ-friendly and LGBTQ-owned restaurants, caf√©s and business by state.
- Access a sortable listing of LGBTQ-friendly community and crisis resources.
- Connect with other Safe Space members via a video chat
- Grow to the Safe Space orbit by contributing to both the resource and business listings.
