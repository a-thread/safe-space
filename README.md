## Description
Members of the LGBTQ community often feel nervous, unsure or unsafe about accessing new business. Frequently, it's a good idea to ask a friend for a recommendation rather than trying a new place, sight unseen. If you are new to an area - relocating for school, work, family or personal reasons - that option may not be available. Safe Space wants to make that process easier, offering users an introduction to their community and an ability to safely expand their orbit, accessing a database of trusted businesses and community organizations.

Users can securely login into the application using a social media account or an email address and password. 

Once in the app, users can:
- Review or update their profiles, including a picture.
- Access a sortable listing of LGBTQ-friendly and LGBTQ-owned restaurants, caf√©s and business by state.
- Access a sortable listing of LGBTQ-friendly community and crisis resources.
- Connect with other Safe Space members via a video chat modules.
- Grow to the Safe Space orbit by contributing to both the resource and business listings.
