## Description
For the LGBTQ community, safety is of utmost importance. The ability to experience the world safely is not a luxury afforded to everyone and most often, members of the LGBTQ community rely on word-of-mouth to find businesses and resources that will provide safe havens and community. One of the most frequent roadblocks is the decentralization of such information.

**Safe Space offers a unique platform that helps the LGBTQ community safely expand their orbit by connecting members with resources, businesses and community.** With Safe Space, members are able to securely and swiftly login with a social media account or email and password to access a database of trusted businesses and community organizations.

Once in the app, users can:
- Review or update their profiles.
- Access a sortable listing of LGBTQ-friendly and LGBTQ-owned restaurants, caf√©s and business by state.
- Access a sortable listing of LGBTQ-friendly community and crisis resources.
- Connect with other Safe Space members via chat
- Grow to the Safe Space orbit by contributing to both the resource and business listings.

Due to the nature of this application, the platform was designed with mobile responsiveness in mind. Users can expect an enjoyable experience on their mobile devices while traveling amongst various safe spaces.
