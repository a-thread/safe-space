            <p>The LGBTQ communtiy has long faced social issues, discrimination and emotional challenges. Chances are,
                you or someone you know is currently enduring these hardships and may not know where or how to reach out
                to others in the community. Safe Space is here to answer that call. Rather than scouring the web for
                local communities and social media groups, you can sign up for your FREE Safe Space account where you
                can find out lots of information about your community, find helpful resources, and even connect on video
                chat with others. We also offer information on LGBTQ friendly, safe and local coffee shops and
                restaurants. So, what are you waiting for? Join us and help us make the LGBTQ community a Safe Space!
